This is a a lame PowerShell implementation of OpenSSH's ssh-copy-id

ssh-copy-id is a PowerShell script that uses ssh to log into a remote machine and append the
indicated identity file to that machine's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. By default, it installs the key(s) stored in `$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`.

CAUTION: This script is not declarative, it will append key(s) into authorized_keys that already exist. It may also be broken and overwrite your authorized_keys file.
